# AI-Driven Personal Data Privacy Audit and Recommendation System

This workflow utilizes multiple data sources and AI analysis to provide users with a comprehensive personal data privacy audit and actionable recommendations for improving their digital privacy.

---

## Overview

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Fetch personal data** from popular platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Google Drive.
2. **Retrieve public data exposure** to discover any publicly available sensitive information.
3. **Combine all gathered data** into a unified dataset.
4. **Analyze the combined data** using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 model to identify privacy risks and provide personalized recommendations.
5. **Send a detailed privacy report via email** to the user.

## Workflow Nodes Detail

### 1. Start

- The initial trigger of the workflow.

---

### 2. Fetch Facebook Profile

- Node Type: `facebook`
- Operation: Retrieve the authenticated user's Facebook profile.
- Authentication: OAuth2 (Facebook OAuth Credentials required)
- Purpose: Collect basic user profile information and social sharing settings that may impact privacy.

---

### 3. Fetch Twitter Tweets

- Node Type: `twitter`
- Operation: Fetch the user's 50 most recent tweets.
- Authentication: OAuth2 (Twitter OAuth Credentials required)
- Purpose: Analyze recent social interactions and potential privacy exposures through tweets.

---

### 4. Fetch Google Drive Files

- Node Type: `googleDrive`
- Operation: List up to 50 files in the user's Google Drive.
- Authentication: OAuth2 (Google Drive OAuth Credentials required)
- Purpose: Review stored files for potentially sensitive information or overly permissive sharing settings.

---

### 5. Fetch Public Data Exposure

- Node Type: `httpRequest`
- Operation: Query public data sources for the user's email or username.
- Purpose: Identify any publicly exposed personal data available on the internet beyond social media.

---

### 6. Combine Data Sources

- Node Type: `function`
- Functionality: Collates the data from Facebook, Twitter, Google Drive, and public data exposure into a single JSON object.
- Purpose: Simplifies the input for the AI-based privacy audit.

---

### 7. AI Privacy Audit and Recommendations

- Node Type: `openAi`
- Model: GPT-4
- Input: Receives combined user data and prompts the AI to:
  - Analyze privacy risks
  - Identify sensitive information and exposure vulnerabilities
  - Suggest personalized, actionable privacy improvements
- Options:
  - Temperature: 0.3 (for focused and accurate output)
  - Max Tokens: 500

---

### 8. Send Privacy Report Email

- Node Type: `emailSend`
- Sends an email containing the AI-generated privacy audit and recommendations.
- Email details:
  - From: `no-reply@privacyaudit.system`
  - To: The user's email address (extracted dynamically from input data)
  - Subject: "Your AI-Driven Personal Data Privacy Audit and Recommendations"
  - Body: Personalized report with suggestions to improve privacy.

- Authentication: SMTP credentials required to send the email.

---

## Credentials Required

- **Facebook OAuth2 API credentials**
- **Twitter OAuth2 API credentials**
- **Google Drive OAuth2 API credentials**
- **SMTP credentials** for sending emails

Each must be configured in the respective nodes for the workflow to operate correctly.

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Configure all OAuth2 credentials for Facebook, Twitter, and Google Drive nodes.
2. Provide SMTP credentials for email delivery.
3. Deploy and activate the workflow.
4. Trigger the workflow (this can be manual or scheduled based on implementation).
5. Upon execution, the workflow fetches all data, performs analysis, and sends the privacy report email to the user.

---

## Notes

- The workflow is designed to respect user privacy by analyzing data only from authorized accounts.
- The AI model parameters can be tweaked for different levels of creativity or verbosity.
- The public data query in the HTTP Request node should be configured with the appropriate API endpoint for the target data source.
- Ensure compliance with all platform policies and regulations when using OAuth2 credentials and accessing user data.
