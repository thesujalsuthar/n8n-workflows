## Workflow Components

### 1. Real-Time Traffic Data
- **Node Type:** HTTP Request
- **Purpose:** Fetches current traffic conditions including delays for various transport modes.
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.trafficservice.example.com/realtime`
- **Method:** GET

### 2. Public Transit Schedules
- **Node Type:** HTTP Request
- **Purpose:** Retrieves up-to-date public transit schedules to incorporate into route planning.
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.transitschedules.example.com/schedules`
- **Method:** GET

### 3. Environmental Impact Metrics
- **Node Type:** HTTP Request
- **Purpose:** Obtains environmental impact data such as carbon footprint metrics relevant to urban transportation.
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.environmentalmetrics.example.com/impact`
- **Method:** GET

## Core Logic

### 4. Optimize Routes
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Combines data from traffic, transit, and environmental metrics to generate personalized route options.
- **Functionality:**
  - Takes real-time traffic, transit schedules, and environmental data.
  - Uses placeholder logic to simulate AI-driven optimization.
  - Creates multiple transport mode options such as bus, bike, walk, and car-sharing.
  - Provides estimated travel times, carbon footprint values, and delay estimates per route.

## Post-Processing and Notifications

### 5. Generate Delay Alerts
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Identifies any routes with delays longer than 5 minutes.
- **Functionality:**
  - Filters routes for significant delays.
  - Generates user-friendly alert messages for delayed routes.
  
### 6. Carbon Footprint Tracker
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Calculates the total carbon footprint for all optimized route options.
- **Functionality:**
  - Sums carbon emissions (kg CO₂) across all proposed routes.
  
### 7. Alternative Transport Suggestions
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Recommends eco-friendlier transport modes.
- **Functionality:**
  - Filters for routes with carbon footprint under 1 kg CO₂.
  - Prioritizes alternatives with estimated travel times under 60 minutes.
  
### 8. Send Delay Alerts Email
- **Node Type:** Email Send
- **Purpose:** Sends email notifications to users with delay alerts.
- **Parameters:**
  - **Email:** User email or defaults to `user@example.com`.
  - **Subject:** "Transit Delay Alert"
  - **Content:** Aggregated delay messages from the previous node.
- **Authentication:** Simple email authentication configured in node options.

## Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Data Gathering:** Simultaneously retrieves data from:
   - Real-Time Traffic Data
   - Public Transit Schedules
   - Environmental Impact Metrics

2. **Route Optimization:** Consolidated data is processed to create optimized, sustainable route options.

3. **Parallel Processing of Output Routes:**
   - Generate delay alerts.
   - Calculate total carbon emissions.
   - Suggest eco-friendly alternatives.

4. **User Notification:**
   - Delay alerts are sent via email to inform users of potential travel disruptions.

## Usage Notes

- **User Location and Destination:** Defaulted to `{ lat: 0, lon: 0 }` if not provided; expected to be supplied in the input JSON (`userLocation` and `userDestination`).
- **Email Field:** Dynamically uses `userEmail` from the JSON input; falls back to `user@example.com` if not set.
- **Scalability:** The current route optimization logic is a placeholder; can be enhanced with AI or advanced optimization algorithms for real deployment.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Includes explicit tracking and recommendations to minimize carbon emissions.
