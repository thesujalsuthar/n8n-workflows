# AI-Powered Smart Urban Garden Care Assistant

This workflow leverages sensor data and AI analysis to provide intelligent plant care recommendations, manage watering schedules, and send pest alerts for a smart urban garden.

---

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of the following key steps:

1. **Get Environmental Data**  
   Fetches real-time environmental sensor data including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels from the garden's API.

2. **Get Plant Health Data**  
   Retrieves plant health metrics such as plant status and pest detection alerts.

3. **Combine Sensor Data**  
   Merges environmental data and plant health data into a single structured JSON object for analysis.

4. **AI Analyze Plant Conditions**  
   Uses the GPT-4 model to analyze combined sensor data and generate:  
   - Plant health assessment  
   - Watering schedule recommendations  
   - Pest detection alerts and advice  
   - Personalized gardening tips  

   The AI outputs a structured JSON object with these insights.

5. **Parse AI JSON Response**  
   Extracts and parses the JSON content from the AI's textual response for further use.

6. **Update Watering System**  
   Sends the recommended watering schedule to the garden's watering system API to automatically adjust irrigation.

7. **Send Pest and Tips Notification**  
   Sends a notification with pest alerts and gardening tips to the garden's notification system to inform the user.

## Nodes Detail

### 1. Get Environmental Data

- **Type:** HTTP Request (GET)  
- **URL:** `http://api.smartgarden.local/sensors/environment`  
- **Response:** JSON containing environmental metrics:
  - `temperature` (Â°C)
  - `humidity` (%)
  - `soilMoisture` (%)
  - `lightLevel` (lux)

### 2. Get Plant Health Data

- **Type:** HTTP Request (GET)  
- **URL:** `http://api.smartgarden.local/sensors/plantHealth`  
- **Response:** JSON data including:
  - `status` (general health assessment)
  - `pestsDetected` (array of detected pests)

### 3. Combine Sensor Data

- **Type:** Function  
- **Function:** Combines the JSON responses from environmental and plant health nodes into a single object:
  ```json
  {
    "temperature": ...,
    "humidity": ...,
    "soilMoisture": ...,
    "lightLevel": ...,
    "plantStatus": ...,
    "pestAlerts": ...
  }
  ```

### 4. AI Analyze Plant Conditions

- **Type:** OpenAI GPT-4  
- **Prompt:** Analyzes combined sensor data and requests JSON output with fields:  
  - `plantAssessment`  
  - `wateringSchedule`  
  - `pestAlerts`  
  - `gardeningTips`

- **Model Parameters:**  
  - Temperature: 0.7  
  - Max Tokens: 300  
  - Top_p: 1  
  - Frequency Penalty: 0  
  - Presence Penalty: 0  

### 5. Parse AI JSON Response

- **Type:** Function  
- **Function:** Parses the AI's text response to extract the JSON object for downstream nodes.

### 6. Update Watering System

- **Type:** HTTP Request (POST)  
- **URL:** `http://api.smartgarden.local/devices/wateringSystem/control`  
- **Request Body:**  
  ```json
  {
    "action": "schedule",
    "schedule": { watering schedule JSON from AI }
  }
  ```

- **Purpose:** Automatically configures the watering system based on AI recommendations.

### 7. Send Pest and Tips Notification

- **Type:** HTTP Request (POST)  
- **URL:** `http://api.smartgarden.local/devices/notificationSystem/send`  
- **Request Body:**  
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Garden Care Alert",
    "message": "Pest Alerts: [detected pests or 'No pests detected']. Gardening Tips: [personalized tips]"
  }
  ```

- **Purpose:** Notifies the user of pest alerts and provides customized gardening advice.

## Workflow Connections

- Environmental and plant health data nodes feed into the **Combine Sensor Data** node.
- Combined data is sent to the **AI Analyze Plant Conditions** node.
- AI response is parsed by the **Parse AI JSON Response** node.
- Parsed AI recommendations are used to update the watering system and send notifications simultaneously.

---

## Requirements

- Access to the smart garden's API at `http://api.smartgarden.local/`
- Valid OpenAI GPT-4 API key configured in the OpenAI node
- Functional devices connected for watering system control and notifications
