## Workflow Overview

1. **Start**  
   Entry point of the workflow.

2. **Analyze Skills and Interests**  
   Uses OpenAI's API to detect and analyze the user's combined skills and interests.

3. **Career Transition Planner (AI)**  
   An AI-based career coach powered by OpenAI generates a personalized transition plan based on the analyzed skills and interests. The AI suggests:
   - Ideal career paths
   - Key skill gaps
   - Recommended upskilling topics
   - Criteria for job opportunities  
   The response is expected in a JSON format with keys: `careerPaths`, `skillGaps`, `upskillTopics`, `jobKeywords`, and `preferredLocation`.

4. **Prepare Query Params**  
   A function node that prepares the query parameters for downstream API calls:
   - Extracts job keywords from the AI suggestions.
   - Determines preferred job location.
   - Gathers upskill topics for course recommendations.

5. **Fetch Job Opportunities**  
   Queries the Adzuna Jobs API with the prepared job keywords and location to retrieve up to 10 relevant job listings.

6. **Get Upskilling Courses**  
   Searches Udemy API for up to 5 courses matching the suggested upskill topics to support closing identified skill gaps.

7. **Generate Session Schedule**  
   Creates a suggested date and time for a follow-up coaching or interview session, defaulting to 3 days from the current date and using the first recommended career path as the session subject.

8. **Schedule Session in Calendar**  
   Adds an event to the user's Google Calendar scheduled for the suggested date/time with details of the specific career path or session purpose.
