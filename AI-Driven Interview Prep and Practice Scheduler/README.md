## Overview

The workflow is triggered via a webhook and follows these main steps:

1. **Receive Job Role and User Information**  
   The user initiates the workflow by sending a request with the target job role and contact details.

2. **Extract Job Role**  
   The workflow extracts the specified job role from the request payload. If none is provided, it defaults to "software engineer".

3. **Search Common Interview Questions**  
   It uses Google Custom Search API to find popular interview questions for the given role.

4. **Extract Relevant Questions**  
   From the search results, it filters and extracts a list of common interview questions. If no relevant questions are found, a default set is provided.

5. **Generate Model Answers Using GPT-4**  
   For each question, a model answer is generated by OpenAI's GPT-4, acting as an expert job coach.

6. **Format Answers**  
   The generated answers are neatly formatted along with their corresponding questions.

7. **Schedule a Practice Session**  
   A Google Calendar event is created for the user to practice their interview questions, set for the next day.

8. **Send Reminders**  
   Customized reminders including the practice session details and model answers are sent to the user's email and messaging app.
