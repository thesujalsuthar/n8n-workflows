# Real-Time AI Crypto Market Volatility Alert System

## Overview

This workflow provides a real-time monitoring system for cryptocurrency market volatility using AI-driven analysis. It fetches live price data for selected cryptocurrencies, analyzes 24-hour price changes, and sends alerts through multiple notification channels if significant volatility is detected.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Cron Trigger
- **Node:** `Cron Trigger`
- **Type:** Cron
- **Function:** Initiates the workflow every 5 minutes (300 seconds) to fetch fresh market data regularly.

### 2. Set Alert Threshold
- **Node:** `Set Alert Threshold`
- **Type:** Set
- **Function:** Defines the minimum 24-hour percentage change threshold (default `5%`) that will trigger an alert notification.

### 3. Fetch Crypto Prices
- **Node:** `Fetch Crypto Prices`
- **Type:** HTTP Request
- **API:** CoinGecko API - `/simple/price`
- **Cryptocurrencies Monitored:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple
- **Currencies:** USD
- **Additional Data:** Includes 24h price percentage change (`include_24hr_change=true`)
- **Function:** Retrieves the current price and 24-hour percent change data for the specified coins.

### 4. AI Volatility Analyzer
- **Node:** `AI Volatility Analyzer`
- **Type:** Function
- **Function:** 
  - Analyzes the fetched price data using basic AI-inspired logic.
  - Compares each coin’s 24-hour price change to the alert threshold.
  - Generates alert messages only for coins exceeding the volatility threshold.
- **Logic:**
  - If absolute value of 24h change ≥ threshold, create an alert object.
  - If no coin exceeds threshold, no alerts are generated.

### 5. Set Notification Preferences
- **Node:** `Set Notification Preferences`
- **Type:** Set
- **Function:** Stores user-customizable contact details and notification channels:
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Telegram chat/channel ID

## Notification Nodes

Alerts generated by the AI analyzer trigger notifications through the following channels:

### 6. Send Email Alert
- **Node:** `Send Email Alert`
- **Type:** Email Send
- **Requirements:** SMTP credentials configured in n8n.
- **Email Content:**
  - Subject includes the cryptocurrency symbol and alert title.
  - Body contains the alert message and exact 24-hour price change.

### 7. Send SMS Alert
- **Node:** `Send SMS Alert`
- **Type:** Twilio
- **Requirements:** Twilio API credentials set up in n8n.
