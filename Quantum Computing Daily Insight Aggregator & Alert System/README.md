# Quantum Computing Daily Research Trend Analyzer & Alert System

## Overview
This workflow automates the daily monitoring, analysis, and alerting of the latest trends and breakthroughs in quantum computing research. It collects data from multiple sources, processes the information using AI, and distributes concise daily summaries to a subscriber list via email and Telegram.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Fetch Research Publications  
**Node Type:** HTTP Request  
**Description:** Retrieves the latest quantum computing-related research publications for the current day from a public research database API.  
**API Endpoint:**  
`https://api.example-research-db.org/v1/publications?query=quantum+computing&from={{ $today }}&to={{ $today }}`  
**Output:** JSON-formatted publication data.

---

### 2. Fetch News Articles  
**Node Type:** HTTP Request  
**Description:** Fetches recent news articles focused on quantum computing from NewsAPI for the current day.  
**API Endpoint:**  
`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=quantum+computing&from={{ $today }}&to={{ $today }}&apiKey=YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY`  
**Output:** JSON containing aggregated news articles.

---

### 3. Fetch Preprints  
**Node Type:** HTTP Request  
**Description:** Collects preprints and early quantum computing research papers published on the same day from a preprint server API.  
**API Endpoint:**  
`https://api.preprint-quantum.org/v1/search?query=quantum+computing&date={{ $today }}`  
**Output:** JSON-formatted preprint data.

---

### 4. Merge Fetch Results  
**Node Type:** Merge  
**Description:** Combines the data streams from the three fetch nodes (Research Publications, News Articles, and Preprints) into a single consolidated data stream for further processing.  
**Mode:** PassThrough (merges inputs without modification)

---

### 5. AI Trend Analyzer & Summarizer  
**Node Type:** OpenAI  
**Description:** Uses the GPT-4o-mini AI model to analyze the combined data on quantum computing for the day. The AI identifies emerging trends, significant breakthroughs, and summarizes the key insights into a concise summary.  
**Prompt Template:**  
```
You are an AI that analyzes recent quantum computing research, news, and preprints. Based on the following data, identify emerging trends, significant breakthroughs, and summarize key insights in a concise manner:

{{ $json.data }}

Return a summary highlighting the most important new developments.
```

---

### 6. Get Subscribers  
**Node Type:** Google Sheets  
**Description:** Fetches the list of subscriber emails and Telegram contacts from a Google Sheets document using Google Sheets API credentials. This list will be used to send alerts.

---

### 7. Send Email Alert  
**Node Type:** Email Send  
**Description:** Sends the AI-generated daily summary report as an email to all subscribers.  
- **From:** alerts@quantumtrend.com  
- **To:** List of subscriber emails (dynamically populated)  
- **Subject:** Quantum Computing Daily Research Highlights - {{ $today }}  
- **Body:** Contains the summary content generated by the AI model.

---

### 8. Send Telegram Alert  
**Node Type:** Telegram  
**Description:** Sends the same daily summary via Telegram messages to a specified Telegram chat ID. This complements the email alerts to ensure timely delivery.  
- **Chat ID:** YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID  
- **Text:** AI-generated summary content.

---

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Fetch Research Publications, News Articles, and Preprints** run in parallel to collect data for the current day.
2. Their outputs are merged into a single stream using the **Merge Fetch Results** node.
3. The merged dataset is passed to **AI Trend Analyzer & Summarizer** for extracting insights.
4. The AI summary triggers the **Get Subscribers** node to fetch subscription contacts.
5. Finally, alerts are sent out via **Send Email Alert** and **Send Telegram Alert** nodes to notify subscribers instantly.

---

## Setup and Configuration

- Replace all placeholder API keys (e.g., `YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY`) with your actual credentials.
- Configure the **Google Sheets API** credentials and ensure the subscriber data is properly formatted in the connected sheet.
- Set your **Telegram Chat ID** in the Telegram alert node.
- Customize the sender email address and other email settings according to your SMTP/email provider.
- Ensure today's date is dynamically passed as `{{ $today }}` in all API calls.
- Enable and schedule the workflow to run daily at your preferred time to automate the trend analysis and alerting process.

---

## Notes

- The workflow is currently inactive (`"active": false`) and needs to be enabled for production use.
- Sensitive API keys and tokens should be securely stored in environment variables or n8n credentials.
- The AI model and prompt can be further customized based on user needs for more detailed or domain-specific analysis.
