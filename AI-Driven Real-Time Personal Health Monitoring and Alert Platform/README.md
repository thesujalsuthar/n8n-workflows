  - Calories Burned
  - Blood Oxygen Level
  - Activity Type

- **Environmental Factors:**
  - Air Quality Index
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pollution Levels
  - Pollen Count

- **Personal Health Records:**
  - Medical History
  - Medications
  - Allergies
  - Lab Results
  - Doctor Notes

---

### 2. Data Ingestion

- **Wearable Integration:**
  - Communication via Bluetooth, WiFi, and API Endpoints
  - Secure Authentication using OAuth2 protocol

- **Environmental Data Integration:**
  - Sources include Public APIs and Local Sensors
  - Real-time data updates to ensure freshness

---

### 3. Data Processing

- **Real-Time Data Pipeline:**
  - Stream processing through Apache Kafka for scalability and speed
  - Data storage using:
    - InfluxDB for time-series data (wearable/environmental metrics)
    - PostgreSQL for relational data (user profiles, records)
  
- **Data Normalization:**
  - Standardizes units and formats across all data sources to ensure consistency

- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Calculates derived metrics such as:
    - Stress Level Estimation
    - Sleep Quality Score
    - Activity Classification (type and intensity)

---

### 4. AI Engine

- **Health Risk Prediction Model:**
  - Utilizes Gradient Boosted Trees
  - Inputs: Heart Rate Variability, Sleep Quality Score, Environmental Factors, Medical History
  - Outputs actionable risk scores indicating potential health concerns

- **Alert Generation System:**
  - Hybrid approach with Rule-based triggers and Machine Learning-based anomaly detection
  - Rules detect events such as elevated heart rate, poor sleep, and dangerous air quality

- **Personalized Recommendations:**
  - Powered by Reinforcement Learning focused on maximizing user health and engagement
  - Example suggestions include:
    - Exercise recommendations
    - Medication reminders
    - Environmental precaution advisories

---

### 5. User Interface

- **Dashboard:**
  - Interactive widgets for:
    - Real-time Vitals
    - Environmental Conditions
    - Health Risks Overview
    - Activity Summary
    - Sleep Analysis
    - Alerts & Notifications
  - Visualizations include graphs, heat maps, trend lines, and notifications
  - Delivered via both Web and Mobile applications to maximize accessibility

- **Alert System:**
  - Multi-channel alerts through push notifications, SMS, and email
  - Alert prioritization levels:
    - Critical
    - Warning
    - Informational
  - Customizable alert preferences set by the user

---

### 6. Security and Privacy

- Data encrypted both in transit and at rest to ensure confidentiality
- Role-based access control restricts data access to authorized personnel
- Data anonymization techniques applied for analysis and reporting to protect privacy
- Comprehensive consent management framework tracks and manages user permissions

---

### 7. Deployment

- Hosted on major cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform
- Auto-scaling enabled with container orchestration for handling variable load efficiently
- Continuous system health monitoring and performance metrics collection ensure reliability
