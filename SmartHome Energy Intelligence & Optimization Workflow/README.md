# AI-Driven Home Energy Consumption Forecast and Optimization

This workflow leverages AI-driven logic to forecast home energy consumption and optimize smart home device settings based on weather forecasts, electricity pricing, and historical energy usage data. It integrates multiple external APIs and applies decision logic to adjust HVAC, lighting, and EV charger devices intelligently.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Retrieve Historical Energy Data**  
   Fetches past home energy consumption data for baseline analysis. This is simulated here in a Function node but can be replaced with real database/API calls.

2. **Get Weather Forecast**  
   Queries a weather API for the forecast of the specified location to estimate how temperature impacts home energy use.

3. **Get Electricity Prices**  
   Retrieves current electricity pricing information for the user's region to factor cost into energy consumption predictions.

4. **Predict Energy Consumption**  
   Combines historical data, weather forecast, and electricity prices to predict daily and weekly energy consumption with heuristic adjustments.

5. **Decide Device Adjustments**  
   Uses prediction and pricing data to decide optimal settings for smart home devices—primarily HVAC, lighting, and EV charger—to balance energy savings and comfort.

6. **Adjust Devices**  
   Sends commands to smart home devices to implement the recommended adjustments automatically.

## Node Details

### 1. Retrieve Historical Energy Data  
- **Type:** Function node  
- **Purpose:** Simulates retrieval of past 7 days’ home energy consumption (kWh) data.  
- **Output:** Array of historical energy usage objects with `date` and `energy_kWh`.

### 2. Get Weather Forecast  
- **Type:** HTTP Request node  
- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.yourweatherprovider.com/v1/forecast`  
- **Parameters:**  
  - `location`: Your specific location string (e.g., city name or coordinates)  
  - `units`: Set to `"metric"` for Celsius  
- **Output:** JSON weather forecast data including daily temperature.

### 3. Get Electricity Prices  
- **Type:** HTTP Request node  
- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.electricitypricingprovider.com/v1/prices/today`  
- **Parameters:**  
  - `region`: Your electricity pricing region/zone identifier  
- **Output:** JSON containing current electricity price per kWh.

### 4. Predict Energy Consumption  
- **Type:** Function node  
- **Inputs:** Historical energy data, weather forecast, electricity prices  
- **Logic:**  
  - Calculates average daily consumption from historical data.  
  - Adjusts consumption prediction based on forecast temperature (higher temps increase usage).  
  - Incorporates current electricity price for context.  
- **Outputs:**  
  - `predictedDailyConsumption` (kWh)  
  - `predictedWeeklyConsumption` (kWh)  
  - `tempAdjustmentFactor`  
  - `currentPrice` (price per kWh)

### 5. Decide Device Adjustments  
- **Type:** Function node  
- **Inputs:** Prediction output with consumption and pricing data  
- **Logic:**  
  - If predicted consumption is high **and** electricity price is high: lower HVAC temperature, dim lights.  
  - If price is low: cooler HVAC setpoint, start EV charger charging.  
  - Otherwise: maintain moderate HVAC and lighting settings.  
- **Outputs:** List of device commands with device name, action, and value.

### 6. Adjust HVAC  
- **Type:** Smart Home node  
- **Action:** Sends temperature adjustment command based on decision logic.  
- **DeviceId:** Replace with your HVAC device identifier.

### 7. Adjust Lighting  
- **Type:** Smart Home node  
- **Action:** Adjusts lighting brightness.  
- **DeviceId:** Replace with your lighting system ID.

### 8. Adjust EV Charger  
- **Type:** Smart Home node  
- **Action:** Starts or stops charging of electric vehicle charger.  
- **DeviceId:** Replace with your EV charger device ID.

## How It Works Together

- The workflow begins by retrieving historical energy usage.
- Triggers parallel HTTP requests to obtain latest weather forecast and electricity pricing.
- The combined data feeds into a predictive model that estimates future energy needs.
- Based on predictions and cost, it decides optimal smart home device settings.
- Commands are then dispatched to respective devices for real-time energy optimization.

## Configuration Notes

- **API Keys & Endpoints:** Replace placeholder API URLs and parameters (`Your_Location`, `Your_Region`) with actual service endpoints and authentication if required.  
- **Device IDs:** Update `HVAC_Device_ID`, `Lighting_Device_ID`, and `EVCharger_Device_ID` with your real smart home device identifiers.  
- **Units:** The example uses metric units. Adjust as needed based on your weather API settings.
