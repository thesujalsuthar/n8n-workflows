## Workflow Components

### 1. Fetch Latest Research Papers
- **Node Type:** arXiv
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the latest 20 research papers related to *quantum computing* from the arXiv repository.
- **Parameters:**
  - `sources`: arXiv
  - `term`: "quantum computing"
  - `maxResults`: 20
  - `return`: metadata

---

### 2. Extract Paper Details
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Processes the raw metadata to extract relevant details including:
  - Paper title
  - Abstract
  - Authors
  - URL/Identifier
  - Publication date
- **Code Summary:** Maps over each paper item and returns a simplified JSON structure containing the above info to be used in downstream nodes.

---

### 3. Generate Embeddings
- **Node Type:** OpenAI (Text Embedding)
- **Purpose:** Converts the abstract of each paper into an embedding vector using OpenAI’s embedding API. These embeddings help capture semantic meaning for trend analysis and clustering.
- **Input:** Paper abstracts (`{{$json.abstract}}`)
- **Credentials Required:** OpenAI API key

---

### 4. Analyze Trends & Cluster
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Simulates clustering of papers into high-level trend categories based on semantic similarity. For demonstration, papers are assigned to one of four predefined clusters:
  - Quantum Algorithms
  - Quantum Hardware
  - Quantum Error Correction
  - Quantum Cryptography
- **Output:** Papers annotated with their corresponding trend cluster.

---

### 5. Fetch Researcher Interests
- **Node Type:** MongoDB
- **Purpose:** Retrieves stored researcher profiles and their keywords of interest from MongoDB.
- **Parameters:** 
  - Collection: `researcherInterests`
  - Query: unfiltered (fetch all, limit 100)
- **Credentials Required:** MongoDB credentials

---

### 6. Match Papers to Interests
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Matches clustered papers to researcher interests by checking if the research keywords appear in the paper’s cluster label, title, or abstract.
- **Logic:**
  - Iterates over each researcher’s keywords.
  - Filters papers containing matching keywords.
  - Groups matched papers for each researcher.
- **Output:** Alert objects containing researcher emails and their matched papers.

---

### 7. Compose Email Summary
- **Node Type:** FunctionItem
- **Purpose:** Creates a detailed email message for each researcher summarizing the matched papers.
- **Content Includes:**
  - Subject line
  - Titles, authors, publication date, and direct link for each matched paper
  - Abstract excerpts
- **Format:** Formatted plain-text email body.

---

### 8. Send Email Alert
- **Node Type:** SMTP
- **Purpose:** Sends the composed email alerts to researchers.
- **Parameters:**
  - From: `no-reply@quantumresearch.ai`
  - To: Researcher’s email
  - Subject: "Quantum Computing Research Updates"
  - Email Body: Email text generated by previous node
- **Credentials Required:** SMTP server credentials

---

## Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Fetch Latest Research Papers** → Retrieves recent quantum computing publications.
2. **Extract Paper Details** → Simplifies and prepares metadata.
3. **Generate Embeddings** → Converts abstracts into AI embeddings.
4. **Analyze Trends & Cluster** → Assigns papers to research trend clusters.
5. Concurrently:
   - **Fetch Researcher Interests** → Loads researcher profiles and keywords.
   - Papers flow into matching process.
6. **Match Papers to Interests** → Links papers with relevant researchers.
7. **Compose Email Summary** → Prepares personalized email content.
8. **Send Email Alert** → Delivers research updates to each researcher.

---

## Requirements & Credentials

- **OpenAI API:** Required for generating text embeddings.
- **MongoDB Database:** Stores researcher profiles and keyword interests.
- **SMTP Server:** Handles sending email alerts.
- **n8n Automation Platform:** Executes the workflow.
