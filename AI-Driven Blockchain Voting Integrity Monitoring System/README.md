# AI-Powered Blockchain Voting Integrity Monitoring Workflow

This workflow is designed to monitor blockchain-based voting transactions in real-time, leveraging AI-driven anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities. When potential irregularities are detected, the system generates and sends alerts via email and a messaging platform for immediate investigation.

---

## Workflow Overview

The workflow performs the following major steps:

1. **Fetch latest blockchain voting transactions**  
2. **Prepare transactions data for AI analysis**  
3. **Send data to AI anomaly detection service**  
4. **Filter transactions flagged as suspicious**  
5. **Generate alert messages detailing suspicious transactions**  
6. **Send alerts via email and messaging platform**

## Detailed Node Descriptions

### 1. Fetch Blockchain Voting Transactions

- **Type:** HTTP Request (GET)  
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the latest voting transactions from the blockchain API endpoint:  
  `https://api.blockchain.example.com/voting/transactions/latest`  
- **Response format:** JSON  
- **Output:** JSON array of transactions containing transaction id, timestamp, voter ID hash, vote data, and digital signature.

---

### 2. Prepare Transactions for AI Analysis

- **Type:** Function Node  
- **Purpose:** Extracts relevant fields from the blockchain transactions and formats the data for input to the AI anomaly detection API.  
- **Output:** Array of formatted transaction objects with fields: `id`, `timestamp`, `voterIdHash`, `voteData`, and `signature`.

---

### 3. AI Anomaly Detection

- **Type:** HTTP Request (POST)  
- **Purpose:** Submits the prepared transactions to a third-party AI anomaly detection API to identify suspicious voting behavior or transaction irregularities.  
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.ai-anomaly.example.com/detect`  
- **Authentication:** Bearer token in HTTP header (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AI_API_KEY`)  
- **Request Body:** Formatted transaction JSON objects  
- **Response:** JSON including an `isSuspicious` boolean flag for each transaction.

---

### 4. Filter Suspicious Transactions

- **Type:** Function Node  
- **Purpose:** Filters out transactions where `isSuspicious` is `true`, isolating potentially fraudulent or irregular transactions for alert generation.

---

### 5. Generate Alert Messages

- **Type:** Function Node  
- **Purpose:** Creates human-readable alert messages for each suspicious transaction.  
- **Message Content:**  
  - Alert subject including transaction ID  
  - Alert body describing the potential tampering, timestamp, voter ID hash, and vote data  
  - Request to investigate immediately

---

### 6. Send Email Alerts

- **Type:** Email Send Node  
- **Purpose:** Sends alert messages via email to election officials.  
- **From:** `election.monitor@example.com`  
- **To:** `election.officials@example.com`  
- **Subject and Body:** Populated dynamically from alert messages generated in the previous step.

---

### 7. Send Messaging Platform Alerts

- **Type:** Telegram Node (can be replaced with other messaging services as needed)  
- **Purpose:** Sends alert messages through a messaging platform (Telegram) to election monitoring teams for rapid notification.  
- **Chat ID:** Configurable (`your_chat_id_here`)  
- **Message Text:** Alert body generated for suspicious transactions.

## Connections Flow

- **Fetch Blockchain Voting Transactions → Prepare Transactions for AI Analysis**  
- **Prepare Transactions for AI Analysis → AI Anomaly Detection**  
- **AI Anomaly Detection → Filter Suspicious Transactions**  
- **Filter Suspicious Transactions → Generate Alert Messages**  
- **Generate Alert Messages → Send Email Alerts**  
- **Generate Alert Messages → Send Messaging Platform Alerts**

---

## Configuration Notes

- Replace `YOUR_AI_API_KEY` with your actual AI anomaly detection API key.  
- Configure the email sender and recipient addresses in the "Send Email Alerts" node as needed.  
- Set the correct `chatId` in the "Send Messaging Platform Alerts" node for your messaging platform integration.  
- The blockchain API endpoint URL can be updated to your actual blockchain vote transactions API.

## Summary

This workflow automates the continuous monitoring of blockchain voting transactions using AI to detect potentially fraudulent or tampered votes and promptly alerts election officials through email and messaging platforms, enhancing election integrity oversight.
