# Quantum Computing Daily Research Digest Aggregator

## Overview

This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting, summarizing, and distributing a daily research digest focused on quantum computing. It fetches the latest quantum computing research papers and news articles from multiple sources, aggregates and summarizes the content using OpenAI's GPT-4, and then emails the digest to subscribers every morning.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Trigger (Schedule Trigger)
- **Type:** Schedule Trigger
- **Description:** Initiates the workflow every day at 08:00 AM.
- **Purpose:** Ensures the digest runs daily at a consistent time.

### 2. Fetch Latest Papers (Crossref)
- **Type:** HTTP Request
- **API:** Crossref API
- **Request:** Searches for the latest 5 research papers with query `quantum computing`, sorted by publication date in descending order.
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Purpose:** Retrieves the most recent academic papers related to quantum computing.

### 3. Fetch News (Quantum Computing Report RSS)
- **Type:** HTTP Request
- **API:** rss2json API wrapping [Quantum Computing Report RSS](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/feed/)
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Purpose:** Fetches the latest news articles related to quantum computing from Quantum Computing Report.

### 4. Fetch News (Space.com)
- **Type:** HTTP Request
- **API:** Space.com Articles API (`section=technology`, `tag=quantum-computing`, limit 5)
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Purpose:** Gathers the latest quantum computing news from Space.com’s technology section.

### 5. Aggregate Data (Function Node)
- **Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Aggregates and restructures the fetched data from Crossref, Quantum Computing Report RSS, and Space.com into unified structured objects.
- **Details:**
  - Extracts title, authors, publication dates, and URLs from papers.
  - Extracts title, link, and publication dates from RSS news.
  - Extracts title, URL, and published dates from Space.com news.
  - Combines all three data sources into a single JSON object.

### 6. Load Subscribers (Function Node)
- **Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Loads an array of subscriber email addresses.
- **Details:** Hardcoded list of subscribers in this example (`subscriber1@example.com`, `subscriber2@example.com`).
- **Usage:** Provides recipients for the daily digest email.

### 7. Summarize Updates (OpenAI)
- **Type:** OpenAI Node (GPT-4)
- **Purpose:** Summarizes the aggregated daily quantum computing updates including research papers and news articles.
- **Prompt:**
  - System message: Defines the role as an assistant summarizing quantum computing research and news into key insights.
  - User message: Provides the JSON data of papers, RSS news, and Space.com news for summarization.
- **Parameters:** GPT-4 model, temperature 0.5, max tokens 700.

### 8. Send Digest Email (Email Send)
- **Type:** Email Send
- **Purpose:** Sends the summarized digest to all subscribers.
- **From Email:** `quantum.digest@example.com`
- **To Email:** Subscriber list loaded from previous node
- **Subject:** "Quantum Computing Daily Research Digest"
- **Email Body:** Summarized content generated by OpenAI node.

### 9. Error Trigger (NoOp)
- **Type:** No Operation Node
- **Purpose:** Acts as an error catcher allowing the workflow to continue even if the email sending step fails.

### 10. Send Error Notification (Email Send)
- **Type:** Email Send
- **Purpose:** Sends an error notification email to the administrator if any failure occurs.
- **From Email:** `quantum.digest@example.com`
- **To Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Subject:** "Error in Quantum Computing Daily Digest Workflow"
- **Email Body:** Contains the error message.

## Workflow Execution Flow

1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts daily at 08:00 AM.
2. **Data Fetch:** Simultaneously requests latest research papers, Quantum Computing Report RSS news, and Space.com news.
3. **Aggregate:** Collected data is aggregated into a structured format.
4. **Subscribers:** Loads the list of email subscribers.
5. **Summarize:** Passes aggregated data to OpenAI GPT-4 for summarization.
6. **Send Digest:** Sends the summarized digest to subscribers.
7. **Error Handling:** Catches any errors in sending the email and notifies the administrator.
