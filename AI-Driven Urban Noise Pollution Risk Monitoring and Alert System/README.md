# AI-Powered Urban Noise Pollution Monitoring and Mitigation Alert System

## Overview
This workflow continuously monitors urban noise pollution by fetching real-time sensor data from citywide noise sensors, processing the data, analyzing noise-related health risks using an AI-powered analytics API, and issuing alerts to residents and city authorities for immediate action.

## Workflow Nodes Description

### 1. Fetch Noise Sensor Data
- **Node Type:** HTTP Request
- **Purpose:** Retrieve real-time noise pollution data from urban environment sensors API.
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.urban-environment-sensors.com/noise-data`
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Parameters:**
  - `area=citywide`
  - `realtime=true`
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Authentication:** None

### 2. Process and Format Sensor Data
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Transform raw sensor data into a structured format suitable for AI analysis.
- **Operation:**
  - Maps sensor readings to objects containing:
    - `noise_level`
    - `timestamp`
    - `location`

### 3. Call AI Analytics API
- **Node Type:** HTTP Request
- **Purpose:** Send processed noise data to an AI analytics service to predict noise pollution health risks.
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.ai-noise-analytics.com/predict-health-risk`
- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **Authentication:** Bearer Token (API Key stored in credentials `AIAnalyticsApi`)
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Payload:** JSON object with noise readings

### 4. Extract Risk Zones
- **Node Type:** Function
- **Purpose:** Parse AI response to identify high-risk noise pollution zones and generate actionable alerts.
- **Operation:**
  - Filters zones where `risk_level` equals `high`
  - Creates alert messages including location, risk level, and recommended mitigation actions
- **Output:** Array of alerts with keys:
  - `location`
  - `risk_level`
  - `message`

### 5. Send Resident Notifications
- **Node Type:** Push Notification
- **Purpose:** Notify residents in high-risk zones about noise pollution alerts.
- **Notification Content:**
  - Title: "Noise Pollution Alert"
  - Body: Alert message from extracted risk zones
- **Recipients:** Users identified by `location + '-residents'`
- **Credentials:** Connected via `UrbanPushNotifications` push notification service

### 6. Send Authorities Alerts
- **Node Type:** Email Send
- **Purpose:** Notify city authorities about urgent high-risk noise pollution zones.
- **Email Details:**
  - To: `city.authorities@urban.gov`
  - Subject: "Urgent: High Noise Pollution Risk Zone Detected"
  - Body: Alert message with location and instructions to take action
- **Credentials:** SMTP service configured as `CityAuthoritySMTP`

## Workflow Execution Flow
1. **Fetch Noise Sensor Data** â†’ retrieves real-time noise data citywide.
2. The data is sent to **Process and Format Sensor Data** for restructuring.
3. Structured data is posted to the **Call AI Analytics API** for risk prediction.
4. AI results are handled by **Extract Risk Zones** to filter and create alerts.
5. Alerts for residents are sent through **Send Resident Notifications**.
6. Simultaneously, alerts for authorities are sent via **Send Authorities Alerts** email.

## Credentials Required
- **AIAnalyticsApi:** API key for accessing AI noise analytics service.
- **pushNotificationApi:** Credentials for urban push notification service.
- **smtp:** SMTP credentials to send alert emails to city authorities.
