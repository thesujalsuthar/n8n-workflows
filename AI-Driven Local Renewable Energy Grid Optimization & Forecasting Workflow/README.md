# AI-Powered Local Renewable Energy Grid Optimization and Demand Forecasting

This workflow integrates multiple data sources related to local renewable energy generation, storage, weather, and consumption. It leverages AI to forecast energy demand and supply, optimize grid operations, and automate management actions while sending alerts for critical situations.

---

## Workflow Overview

The workflow performs the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Retrieves current data from multiple APIs:
   - Solar energy generation data
   - Wind energy generation data
   - Storage system status
   - Local weather conditions
   - Energy consumption data

2. **Data Aggregation**  
   Combines all collected data into a consolidated JSON object to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the local energy environment.

3. **AI Forecasting & Optimization**  
   Sends the aggregated data to an AI model (GPT-4) designed for renewable energy grid analysis to:
   - Forecast next 24-hour energy demand and renewable supply
   - Optimize grid balancing and energy storage management
   - Identify energy optimization opportunities and potential alerts

4. **Response Parsing**  
   Extracts and formats the AI's JSON response containing:
   - Forecasted demand and supply
   - Storage recommendations
   - Grid balancing actions
   - Alerts

5. **Alert Handling**  
   Sends an email alert to grid management if any important notifications or warnings are generated by the AI.

6. **Automation Commands Preparation**  
   Converts AI recommendations into actionable commands formatted for API-based grid and storage system controls.

7. **Executing Automation Actions**  
   Sends POST requests to local system APIs to:
   - Adjust grid balancing parameters
   - Manage energy storage systems accordingly

## Data Flow & Connections

- Data collection nodes (`Get Solar Data`, `Get Wind Data`, `Get Storage Status`, `Get Weather Data`, `Get Consumption Data`) feed parallel inputs into the `Aggregate Data` node.
- The aggregated data is passed to the `AI Forecast & Optimization` node.
- AI-generated forecasts and recommendations are parsed by the `Parse AI Response` node.
- The parsed output triggers both:
  - Preparation of automation commands for grid and storage
  - Email alerts for grid management
- Automation commands are subsequently sent to system APIs for real-time operational adjustments.

This workflow automates the integration of local renewable energy data with advanced AI analytics to enable:

- Accurate short-term demand and supply forecasting
- Intelligent grid balancing and energy storage optimization
- Proactive alerts for potential issues
- Seamless automation of energy system controls

By doing so, it helps improve efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the local renewable energy grid.
