## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Resume Upload
- **Description:** Candidates upload their resumes in various formats including PDF, DOCX, and TXT.
- **Input:**
  - `resume_file` (file): The candidate's resume in any supported format.
- **Output:**
  - `uploaded_resume` (file): The uploaded resume file, passed forward for processing.

### Step 2: Resume Parsing
- **Description:** An AI-powered parsing module extracts structured data from the uploaded resume. Extracted fields include personal details, skills, work experience, education, and certifications.
- **Input:**
  - `uploaded_resume` (file): The candidateâ€™s uploaded resume.
- **Process:** AI Model for resume parsing based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
- **Output:**
  - `parsed_resume` (object) with fields:
    - `personal_details`:
      - `name` (string)
      - `email` (string)
      - `phone` (string)
      - `address` (string)
    - `skills` (array of strings)
    - `work_experience` (array of objects):
      - `job_title` (string)
      - `company` (string)
      - `start_date` (date)
      - `end_date` (date)
      - `description` (string)
    - `education` (array of objects):
      - `degree` (string)
      - `institution` (string)
      - `start_date` (date)
      - `end_date` (date)
    - `certifications` (array of strings)

### Step 3: Job Database Access
- **Description:** Retrieves the current active job openings including detailed job descriptions, required skills, qualifications, and other relevant data.
- **Input:** None
- **Output:**
  - `job_listings` (array of objects), each containing:
    - `job_id` (string)
    - `title` (string)
    - `description` (string)
    - `required_skills` (array of strings)
    - `qualifications` (array of strings)
    - `location` (string)
    - `employment_type` (string)

### Step 4: Candidate-Job Matching
- **Description:** Matches the parsed candidate resume data against job listings using AI algorithms. Matches are based on skill overlap, experience relevance, and location preferences to determine the best fit.
- **Input:**
  - `parsed_resume` (object): Parsed candidate profile.
  - `job_listings` (array): Available job openings.
- **Process:** AI Matching Algorithm utilizing similarity scoring and ranking techniques.
- **Output:**
  - `matched_jobs` (array of objects), each provides:
    - `job_id` (string)
    - `match_score` (float): Overall fit score.
    - `relevance_details` (object):
      - `skills_match_percentage` (float)
      - `experience_match` (boolean)
      - `location_preference_match` (boolean)

### Step 5: Results Presentation
- **Description:** Displays the AI-generated job recommendations to candidates, allowing them to review job details and proceed with applications.
- **Input:**
  - `matched_jobs` (array): List of recommended job matches.
- **Output:**
  - `recommendation_list` (array of objects), each includes:
    - `job_id` (string)
    - `title` (string)
    - `match_score` (float)
    - `apply_link` (string): URL or action link to apply for the job.
