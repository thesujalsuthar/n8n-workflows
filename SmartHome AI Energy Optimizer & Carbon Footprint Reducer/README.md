## Workflow Nodes and Functionality

### 1. Get Real-Time Energy Consumption
- **Type:** Smart Home Device Node
- **Purpose:** Retrieves current energy consumption data from all smart devices in the home.
- **Parameters:**
  - `resource`: Device status data (`deviceStatus`)
  - `operation`: Fetches real-time consumption (`getRealTimeConsumption`)
  - `deviceIds`: Empty array (fetches data for all devices)
- **Output:** JSON containing up-to-date energy usage per device.

---

### 2. Get Local Renewable Energy Data
- **Type:** API Request Node
- **Purpose:** Fetches renewable energy availability data based on the homeowner's location.
- **Parameters:**
  - `resource`: Renewable energy data (`renewableEnergy`)
  - `operation`: Get availability info (`getLocalAvailability`)
  - `location`: Dynamically set to the home’s location (`={{$json["homeLocation"]}}`)
- **Output:** JSON data representing local renewable energy sources and availability.

### 3. Optimize Device Usage Schedules
- **Type:** Function Node
- **Purpose:** Processes real-time energy consumption and renewable energy availability to create an optimized schedule for device operations.
- **Logic:**
  - Combines consumption and renewable data.
  - Placeholder code demonstrates scheduling device usage during optimal times to maximize renewable use and reduce peak consumption.
  - Example schedule output:
    ```json
    {
      "livingRoomLight": { "start": "18:00", "end": "22:00" },
      "HVAC": { "start": "06:00", "end": "09:00" },
      "washingMachine": { "start": "14:00", "end": "16:00" }
    }
    ```
- **Output:** JSON containing optimized device usage schedules.

### 4. Generate Carbon Footprint Reduction Tips
- **Type:** OpenAI Node (GPT-4)
- **Purpose:** Generates personalized, actionable tips for the homeowner to reduce their carbon footprint.
- **Prompt:**
  - The AI receives current energy consumption and local renewable energy data.
  - It acts as a sustainable home energy assistant.
- **Parameters:**
  - Model: `gpt-4`
  - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
  - Maximum tokens: 250
  - User: `homeowner`
- **Output:** Text content with tailored advice on sustainable energy use.

---

### 5. Apply Optimized Schedule to Devices
- **Type:** Smart Home Device Node
- **Purpose:** Updates the schedules of smart devices to the optimized timetable generated by the workflow.
- **Parameters:**
  - `resource`: Device control (`deviceControl`)
  - `operation`: Update device schedules (`updateSchedule`)
  - `deviceId`: Dynamically selects the first device from the optimized schedule keys.
  - `schedule`: Corresponding schedule times.
- **Note:** This node can be expanded for all devices in the schedule.

---

### 6. Send Report and Alerts to Homeowner
- **Type:** Email Send Node
- **Purpose:** Sends an email to the homeowner with a detailed report containing:
  - Optimized device schedules.
  - AI-generated carbon footprint reduction tips.
- **Parameters:**
  - `toEmail`: Email address dynamically pulled from input (`={{$json["homeownerEmail"]}}`)
  - `subject`: "Smart Home Energy Optimization Report and Tips"
  - `text`: Summary including optimized schedules and AI-generated tips.

---

## Workflow Connections

- **Get Real-Time Energy Consumption** and **Get Local Renewable Energy Data** feed data into both:
  - **Optimize Device Usage Schedules**
  - **Generate Carbon Footprint Reduction Tips**
  
- **Optimize Device Usage Schedules** triggers **Apply Optimized Schedule to Devices** to update device settings.

- **Generate Carbon Footprint Reduction Tips** triggers **Send Report and Alerts to Homeowner**.

---

## Setup & Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Smart home system with API access to device data and control.
   - Access to a renewable energy data API that supports location-based queries.
   - OpenAI API credentials with access to GPT-4.
   - Email service configured for sending reports.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Provide the homeowner’s location and email via input JSON.
   - Ensure device IDs and smart device integration are properly set up.
   - Replace placeholders in the optimization function with actual scheduling logic if needed.

3. **Activation:**
   - Execute this workflow regularly (e.g., hourly, daily) to continually adapt to energy usage and renewable energy availability.
   - Review reports sent via email to monitor energy savings and follow AI tips.

---

## Customization

- Modify the **Optimize Device Usage Schedules** function to implement advanced optimization algorithms tailored to your devices and preferences.
- Expand the **Apply Optimized Schedule to Devices** node to update all devices listed in the optimized schedule.
- Adjust OpenAI prompt or parameters for more specific advice tailored to your home setup.
