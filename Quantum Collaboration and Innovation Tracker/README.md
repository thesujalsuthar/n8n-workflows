# Quantum Computing Research Collaboration and Innovation Tracker

This workflow automates the monitoring, analysis, and dissemination of recent quantum computing research papers to facilitate collaboration and innovation within the research community.

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Fetch Quantum Research RSS Feed
- Fetches the latest research papers from the [arXiv Quantum Physics RSS feed](https://arxiv.org/rss/quant-ph) via an HTTP request.
- Retrieves XML data in RSS format.

### 2. Parse RSS XML to JSON
- Converts the fetched XML feed into a structured JSON format.
- Extracts key information for each paper, including:
  - Title
  - Link to the paper
  - Publication date
  - Description (abstract)
  - Authors (both raw and split into individual names)

### 3. Extract Collaboration Opportunities
- Analyzes the title and description of each paper for relevant quantum computing keywords:
  - entanglement
  - quantum algorithms
  - quantum error correction
  - quantum cryptography
  - quantum annealing
  - superconducting qubits
  - topological quantum computing
  - quantum machine learning
  - quantum simulation
  - quantum supremacy
- Flags papers with multiple authors or containing one or more of these keywords as potential collaboration opportunities.
- Attaches extracted topics and collaboration flags to each paper's data.

### 4. Notify Researchers via Email
- Automatically sends personalized emails to the authors of each paper flagged for collaboration opportunities.
- Email content includes:
  - Paper title
  - Relevant quantum computing topics detected
  - Link to the paper
  - Encouragement to consider collaboration
- Author emails are generated by appending `@quantumresearch.org` to author names parsed from the feed.
- Requires SMTP credential configuration (`SMTP Account`).

### 5. Notify Teams on Slack
- Posts a notification message to the Slack channel `#quantum-collaborations`.
- The message includes:
  - Paper title
  - Detected topics
  - Authors
  - Paper link
- Requires Slack API credential configuration (`Slack Account`).

### 6. Group by Topic
- Groups all papers by the quantum computing topics detected.
- Helps in aggregating papers per topic for further analysis.

### 7. Count Topic Frequencies
- Counts how many papers are associated with each quantum computing topic.
- Generates a summary object with topic names and their respective counts.

### 8. Visualize Trending Topics
- Creates a bar chart visualization of trending quantum computing topics based on frequency counts.
- Chart details:
  - Title: "Trending Topics in Quantum Computing Research"
  - X-axis label: Topics
  - Y-axis label: Number of Papers
  - Dimensions: 700 x 400 pixels

## Execution Flow

1. **Fetch Quantum Research RSS Feed** nodes trigger and retrieve the latest papers.
2. **Parse RSS XML to JSON** formats the data into structured JSON.
3. **Extract Collaboration Opportunities** analyzes content and identifies potential collaboration papers.
4. Identified papers trigger:
   - **Notify Researchers via Email**
   - **Notify Teams on Slack**
   - **Group by Topic** for aggregation.
5. Grouped data flows to **Count Topic Frequencies**.
6. Frequency data is then visualized in **Visualize Trending Topics** chart.

## Benefits

- Maintains a real-time tracker of the latest quantum computing research.
- Highlights collaboration opportunities by detecting multi-author papers and key quantum topics.
- Automatically notifies researchers and teams to foster prompt engagement and innovation.
- Provides visual insights into trending topics in the quantum computing field.

---

## Notes

- Email addresses for authors are auto-generated by appending `@quantumresearch.org`. Adjust this logic as required based on actual author contact information.
- Keyword list in the extraction step can be updated to reflect evolving research interests.
- Slack channel name and email recipients can be customized in the respective nodes.
- Ensure all credentials are securely configured before workflow activation.
