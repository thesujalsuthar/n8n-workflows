# AI-Powered Sustainable Grocery Assistant

This workflow helps users create a personalized sustainable grocery list highlighting organic and local products while estimating the carbon footprint of each item. It also sends daily sustainable shopping tips via email to encourage eco-friendly habits.

---

## Overview

The workflow accepts a user's grocery query and email, fetches sustainable product recommendations from an external API focusing on local and organic items, estimates the carbon footprint for each product, formats the list with carbon data, and sends the compiled grocery list along with sustainable shopping tips via email.

Additionally, it sends a daily email with a sustainable shopping tip as a reminder to users.
