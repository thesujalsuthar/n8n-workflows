# Privacy Incident Monitoring Workflow

This workflow automates the detection, reporting, and notification process for potential personal data privacy incidents based on incoming JSON data streams. It leverages AI analysis, incident logging, notifications, and personalized privacy recommendations.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Incoming Data Webhook**
   - Listens for incoming POST requests on the `/privacy-incident-monitor` path.
   - Triggered when JSON data suspected of containing privacy incidents is received.

2. **Analyze for Privacy Incidents**
   - Sends the incoming data to an AI model (`gpt-4o-mini`) for analysis.
   - The AI evaluates the data and returns either:
     - `"No Incident Detected"`, or
     - A detailed incident report including type, severity, and affected data.

3. **Filter No Incident**
   - Checks the AI response.
   - If the response is `"No Incident Detected"`, the workflow stops processing further.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds with incident handling.

4. **Generate User Alert Message**
   - Creates a clear alert message incorporating the AI-generated incident report.
   - The message notifies the user that immediate action is required.

5. **Send User Alert Email**
   - Sends the alert message to the user via email.
   - Uses SMTP credentials configured as `User Email SMTP`.
   - The recipient email is extracted from the incoming data's `userEmail` field or an environment variable `USER_EMAIL`.

6. **Log Incident to DB**
   - Stores the incident report in a MongoDB collection named `privacy_incidents`.
   - Includes the incident report and the timestamp of receipt.
   - Uses configured MongoDB credentials `MongoDB Incident Log`.

7. **Generate Personalized Privacy Measures**
   - Uses the AI model to generate a set of personalized privacy measures and automated response actions.
   - The suggestions are tailored to the details of the detected incident.

8. **Notify Authorities**
   - Sends a POST request to an external authority API (`https://example-authority-notify.org/api/report`) to report the incident.
   - The payload includes the incident report, current timestamp, and user contact information.

9. **Generate Privacy Suggestion Message**
   - Formats the AI-generated privacy recommendations into a user-friendly message.

10. **Send Privacy Measures Email**
    - Sends the personalized privacy measures email to the user.
    - Uses the same SMTP credentials and recipient determination as the alert email.
